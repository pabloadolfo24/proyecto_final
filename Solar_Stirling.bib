abstract = {This chapter examines the conditions under which thermal concentrating solar power (CSP) systems might play a large role in the global energy system during the 21st century. As PV prices have dropped dramatically, the main role of CSP plants will be to provide electricity precisely when the sun is not shining. This can be naturally done thanks to the reliable and relatively cheap thermal storage, which might offer additional services to the electrical system. The potential for a large CSP deployment in different regions at the world level is also analysed.},
